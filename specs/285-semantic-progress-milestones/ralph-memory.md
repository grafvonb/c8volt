# Ralph Memory

Feature: 285-semantic-progress-milestones
Started: 2026-08-31T17:14:26Z

## Codebase Patterns
- Active feature artifacts live under `specs/285-semantic-progress-milestones/`; Ralph iterations for this feature must include `--implementation-context specs/ralph-implementation-rules.md`.
- Branch is `285-semantic-progress-milestones`; issue-backed commit subjects for this feature use Conventional Commits with scope `ralph` and end with `#285`.

## Decisions
- Phase 1 setup was completed as a tracking-only work unit before any source implementation.
- The canonical completion fact is `OpsCompletionProgress` / `CompletionProgress` with `submitted`, `confirmed`, and `failed` dispositions; `AffectedCount *int` distinguishes unavailable from trustworthy zero.
- Completion facts are mirrored mechanically through `c8volt/foptions` and `c8volt/ops`; command wording remains out of domain, services, and facades.
- The first command reporter scaffold is isolated in `cmd/ops_semantic_progress.go`; it owns one workflow-priority activity, mutex-protected completion aggregation, affected-count invalidation, family vocabulary, and idempotent close.
- Completion output policy stays command-local in `cmd/ops_progress_mode.go`: default human allows transient and future paced aggregate progress, verbose/debug allow per-item durable lines, quiet allows failure warnings only, and JSON/keys-only/automation stay silent.

## Gotchas
- `progress.md` and `ralph-memory.md` started untracked in this worktree; include them with the coordinated task commit.
- `c8volt/foptions` previously had no test file; `c8volt/foptions/options_test.go` now covers service-to-facade progress callback mapping.
- `cmd/ops_analyse_slow_process_instances_progress_test.go` participates in broader `Progress|Activity` runs; apply output-mode globals after `resetOpsSlowProcessAnalysisTestFlags(t)` because that helper now clears shared mode flags for isolation.

## Reusable Commands
- `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`
- `go test ./internal/domain ./c8volt/foptions ./c8volt/ops ./toolx/logging -race -count=1`
- `go test ./internal/domain ./c8volt/foptions ./c8volt/ops ./internal/services -race -count=1`
- `go test ./cmd -run 'Progress|Activity' -race -count=1`
- `git diff --check`

## Do Not Repeat
- Do not reintroduce semantic progress wording into services or facade converters; completion facts remain wording-free and command renderers choose verbs.

## Current Handoff
- Next iteration should begin User Story 1 at T007 by adding concurrent out-of-order aggregate, affected-coverage invalidation, and workflow-priority activity tests in `cmd/ops_semantic_progress_test.go` and `toolx/logging/activity_test.go`.
